# How to contribute

## Reporting Bugs

Bugs are tracked as [GitHub issues](https://github.com/codeclimate/velocity-deploy-action/issues). After you've confirmed the issue hasn't be reported before, you can open an issue explaining the problem and including additional details to help us reproduce the problem:

* Use a clear and descriptive title.
* Describe the exact steps which reproduce the problem in as much detail as possible.
* Describe the behavior you observed after following the steps.
* Explain which behavior you expected to see instead and why.
* Include screenshots or animated GIFs whenever possible.

## Submitting changes

Please open a GitHub Pull Request with a clear title and desciption (read more about [pull requests](http://help.github.com/pull-requests/)). Please make sure all of your commits are atomic (one feature per commit). Always write a clear log message for your commits. One-line messages are fine for small changes, but bigger changes should include more details.

Thank you!
